&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I made my first portfolio website using wordpress. As you are probably aware, this is a poor choice for this kind of website. It implies paying for a hosting and have an overload of features that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With alternatives outthere such as being able to host a static site in github-pages, I decided to change the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an IT professional with some coding background, I moved to Jekyll initially. It is Ruby based, which I don&amp;rsquo;t like, but Jekyll itself once the setup is done is faily easy to manage. However, despite I invested several hours on it, I never released that website.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
