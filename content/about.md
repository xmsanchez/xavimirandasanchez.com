## Personal Background

I'm located in Barcelona. I was born a cold january in 1986 and I've always grown with a computer in my reach. Both my parents and also my brother are IT professionals and I began interacting with computers back in 1990 with an amstrad-PC, later upgrading to a 386, 486, and my first pentium with a voodoo card.

I've always liked videogames a lot and I've also have been interested in art, starting with 3d studio when I was 12 years old and also did some pixel art when pixel art wasn't even a thing.

Lately, though, I decided to move to a more abstract branch of IT, and here I am today.

## Professional Background

I've worked for almost over a decade as a SRE / DevOps role (lately in a Platform engineering position) and I also have a rich background in system administration, starting 20 years ago when I landed in my first job. My journey in DevOps began in 2017, when I started transitioning from legacy systems to cloud-native platforms.

I've worked with lots of tools and have solid experience in the following:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible, Saltstack.
- **Pipelines management**: github-ci, Bitbucket Pipelines, Azure Devops Pipelines, github-actions, Jenkins.
- **Cloud**: Minimum of 2 years in all of the following: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.
- **Containerization**: Docker and docker-compose, ECS (aws).
- **Kubernetes on-premise**: Kubespray, Rancher, Kubesphere.
- **Kubernetes cloud**: EKS (aws), GKE (google cloud), AKS (azure).
- **Kubernetes-related tooling**: ArgoCD, Argo Workflows, Teleport, nginx-controller, some istio.
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Thanos, Grafana Mimir, Grafana, Loki, ELK (Elasticserach, Logstash / FluentBit, Kibana), OpenTelemetry.
- **Coding**: Not my strongest skill, but I have fairly solid python level. I also have some limited experience with: Javascript, Java (I published a couple android apps +10 years ago), Visual Basic .NET. I have solid experience using GPT and Gemini, though ;-D

## Personal Journey

My journey in IT started 20 years ago fixing computers. I also managed Windows and Linux servers migrating MySQL databases, managed physical networks, and so on.

After 12 years, I moved to a company with a large on-premise infrastructure based on ESX servers. We managed a farm of VMWare servers that supported an e-commerce platform that sold millions every day (Privalia, now part of Vente Priveé).

It was at this point when I entered the DevOps world. I started this new job right when they were starting to migrate to the Cloud (AWS) and not much later more specifically to Kubernetes.

I've always have had a focus on observability tasks and NOC systems, so I have a fairly strong experience on that, too.
