## Introduction

A few years ago, I made my first portfolio website using wordpress. As you are probably aware, this is a poor choice for this kind of website. It implies paying for a hosting and have an overload of features that I'm not going to use. 

With alternatives outthere such as being able to host a static site in github-pages, I decided to change the approach.

Being an IT professional with some coding background, I moved to Jekyll initially. It is Ruby based, which I don't like, but Jekyll itself once the setup is done is faily easy to manage. However, despite I invested several hours on it, I never released that website.

## The new era of AI

Now, at the end of 2025 with tools like Cursor and very powerful models out there, I decided to move to Hugo and vibe-code my way to github-pages.

Of course, I could be doing the code myself. But what's the point? I'm one of those people with the opinion that the future is not in coding everything but instructing the future LLMs and agents what to do and tailor it to your needs.

Therefore, I'm presenting an almost 100% vibe-coded website that I'll be using as a personal and professional website.

## What's Next

Not sure yet. I'll be sharing some ideas in this blog, some focused in platform enginneering / devops, some others in AI, and maybe some with nothing to do with IT, who knows.

See you the next year!
