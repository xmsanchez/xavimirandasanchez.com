&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I made my first portfolio website using wordpress. As you are probably aware, this is a poor choice for this kind of website. It implies paying for a hosting and have an overload of features that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With alternatives outthere such as being able to host a static site in github-pages, I decided to change the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an IT professional with some coding background, I moved to Jekyll initially. It is Ruby based, which I don&amp;rsquo;t like, but Jekyll itself once the setup is done is faily easy to manage. However, despite I invested several hours on it, I never released that website.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://xavimirandasanchez.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavimirandasanchez.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="personal-background"&gt;Personal Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m located in Barcelona. I was born a cold january in 1986 and I&amp;rsquo;ve always grown with a computer in my reach. Both my parents and also my brother are IT professionals and I began interacting with computers back in 1990 with an amstrad-PC, later upgrading to a 386, 486, and my first pentium with a voodoo card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked videogames a lot and I&amp;rsquo;ve also have been interested in art, starting with 3d studio when I was 12 years old and also did some pixel art when pixel art wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
